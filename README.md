Metis Final Project:
Using NLP from reviews to predict and recommend Scotch whisky.

<u>This project uses:</u>
- Recommendaiton Systems
- Neural Networks
- NLP

### Introduction and Objectives:

------

### Data Used:

The data comes from the [Whisky Advocate](https://www.whiskyadvocate.com/), and then gathered from a Kaggle dataset. 




------

### Tools Used:
- pandas
- nltk
- numpy
- scipy
- sklearn
- NMF
- plotly
- wordcloud

------

      - Second type of topic modeling performed. Was the worst results.
  - 5 NMF Model #1 (TfidfVectorizer).png
      - The best model from topic modeling. Gave the best topic results.
  - 6 NMF Model #2 (CountVectorizer).png
      - Another form of NMF topic modeling, good results, similar to first model.

### Possible Impacts and Practical Applications:
From the topic modeling of our data, we found the NMF model using TfidfVectorization provided the best overall results and topics for our data. These topics give us a generally good understanding of what flavor categories we have for scotch (based on this dataset). This project simply, emphasizes the need to utilize and understand NLP in the whisky industry!

### Future Work:
NLP has become very popular among product development researchers, and producers. 
  
Overall, we have learned how NLP could be used to help understand and solve global problems that affect 

Future work revolves around gethering more text data for more whiskies
