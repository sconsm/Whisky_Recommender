    "I am creating a recommendation system using NLP by exploring the text from review descriptions. This begins the NLP process. First, we must clean and preprocess the text data, before we can do any modeling. After I perform NMF topic modeling, I will create the NMF text recommendation system by finding pairwise distances using cosine similarities. From here I hope to make an interesting and useful system that helps Scotch lovers find bottles with flavors and tastes they like. The recommendationsystem will allow the user to choose from a list of flavor options (based on topic modeling). They will also be able to enter their own description, or even choose a buit in bottle ID from the dataset and get the most similar bottle to that choice. This will be deployed on a Streamlit web app!"

    "In this next part, I will be applying two machine learning models. First, logistic regression to predict the accuracy of a whisky category, using both count and tfidf vectorization, and word2vec embeddings. Second, using neural networks, I will use an LSTM (RNN) model that takes in GloVe for transfer learning. The evaluation metric for both is accuracy. "
